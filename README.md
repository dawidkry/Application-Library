# Application-Library
Dr. Krynicki’s App Laboratory 🩺💻
Clinical Physician by day | Full-Stack Explorer by night.

This repository serves as a centralized "Personal Library" for my non-medical software projects. While my professional life is dedicated to medicine, these projects represent my journey into [mention your stack, e.g., React, Python, or Swift] and my passion for building tools that solve everyday problems.

Why I Build
In medicine, we follow protocols to save lives. In coding, I enjoy the freedom to build systems from scratch. These apps are my "creative consults"—projects where I explore logic, automation, and UI/UX design outside the constraints of the healthcare system.

Languages: Python

I’m always open to discussing the intersection of health-tech, or simply geeking out over clean code.

LinkedIn: To be linked in future
